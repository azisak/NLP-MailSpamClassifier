DQDQIt must be horrible being a dial-up user in 2002. If we can *automate* DQrsync submission with good *authentication*, it would be fine with me. DQThe current rsync method is not sufficiently authenticated, though. I'll take a look at it. I'm sure there's got to be some reasonly easy way to have rsync carry itself over ssh and secure access using ssh keys. DQI suggest we use the hughes-family.org server for rsyncing, as we do for DQthe corpus_submit stuff -- in a separate subdirectory, though! -- then DQI'll take a look at getting a nightly hit-frequencies-collation system DQgoing. Ok, I'll take a look at it. C
