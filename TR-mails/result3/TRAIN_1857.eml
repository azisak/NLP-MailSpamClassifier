RGB Balance video effectI'm trying to apply an RGB Balance effect (kRGBColorBalanceImageFilterType) to a video track, and I just end up with a movie that's solid black all the way through. I have working code that uses a cross-fade effect, and a lot of the code is the same. I'm guessing that the most likely location of the problem is in constructing the effect description. Here's the code: QTAtomContainer atomCont; OSStatus err = QTNewAtomContainer(  The docs say that the 3 parameters can be tweens, so I thought, well, maybe they must be tweens, but I had no better luck when I tried making them tweens. Any idea what I could be doing wrong? Or any suggestions on how to debug it? -- James W.
