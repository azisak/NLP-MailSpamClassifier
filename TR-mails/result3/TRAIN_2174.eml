In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry. TOP OF PAGE November 21, 1994: News Release In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: "Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island" and stated: "Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: =C2=BB =C2=BB Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was "decommissioned" more than a decade ago. =C2=BB =C2=BB In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. =C2=BB =C2=BB Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. =C2=BB =C2=BB A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since "formal" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese "natural" rights, including those of ownership and use of land. Still mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military might and the willingness to use it against even the smallest of nations (e.g. Grenada, Haiti, Cuba, Hawaii, etc., etc.), Mr. Moore, other Ministers and the citizens of EnenKio are determined to peacefully displace the U.S. Occupation Forces and reassert the jurisdiction of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios. Filing the Commercial Affidavit document was the first major legal step in a series of actions that could end up in International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands. In an effort to garner support for the repatriation of her citizens, the restoration of democratic control of EnenKio and to gain international recognition of the innumerable native rights violations against the Sovereign and his forebears, the Ministers of EnenKio have sent documents of Notice and request for assistance to the United Nations Security Council, the South Pacific Commission, similar organizations and to the governments of most other nations of the world. It is hoped that mutual recognition of sovereignty and the establishment of diplomatic ties will invite the willful withdrawal of U.S. troops and relinquishment of their unfounded territorial claims. At the same time, Mr. Moore, in the service of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, wishes to inform all of the people being held at Wake Island by force of arms or by contract, that asylum will be offered to them. A similar offer is made to all Marshallese descendants who desire to become citizens of EnenKio.
