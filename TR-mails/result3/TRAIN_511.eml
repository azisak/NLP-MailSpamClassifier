Backup CDs are copies of Software. For example if you go into a shop and buy Windows XP Pro, for about $299 you get the Serial, the CD, the Box and the Manual.If you order it off us, you get:The Windows XP CD and the Serial Number. It works exactly the same, but you don't get the manual and box and the price is only $19.99.That is a saving of $280, and the only difference is you don't have a colorful box and manual - which are not very useful.
