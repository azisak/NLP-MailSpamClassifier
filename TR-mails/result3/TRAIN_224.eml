My Good EasyURL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/07.html#my_good_easy Date: 2002-10-07T17:59:05-05:00 _Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. also set as my home directory using the HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is my single most backed-up possession. Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI [16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].
