Re: Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...)Ah yes.. Yet another case where 'marriage' is actually an inappropriate word for these guys. What they want is 'housekeeper' 'dog' and 'prostitute'. All I can say, is I hope these girls come out, take the men for what they have, be glorified housekeepers for as short a term as possible, and enjoy the free travel. Love my arse. -BB ALB...an alternative to the "kind of de-feminized, over-sized, self-centered, ALBmercenary-minded lady available on the British singles scene," ALBGlad to see American culture is making it's way into the British bars too :) ALBGod bless us uncivilized bastards, every one. ALBStill, definately something not right about the below. People are now ALBcheaper then a decent laptop? (ok, so we knew that already) ALB------------- ALBSelling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand ALBThu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET ALBBy Andrew Marshall ALBBANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand ALBlooking for a wife. It took two hours to find her. ALB"The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all ALBmy clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous," he said. "I ALBknew then there was something special." ALBMoylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet ALB-- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan, ALBwho is expecting their first child. ALBCritics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women ALBin developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that ALBoften turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand ALBin search of a wife. ALB"I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan," he said. "I knew I ALBfound her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring." ALBMoylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in ALBtouch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and ALBthe couple married. ALBMR. MARRIAGE ALBLawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency ALBMoylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself "Mr. Marriage," ALBstarted the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction ALBagency. ALBSince then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages. ALB"In the last five years we've done about 400," he said. "To the best of my ALBknowledge, they have all been successful." ALBMale clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that ALBrequire them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount. ALBClients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women ALBlooking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok. ALBClients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's ALBoffice -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and ALBlanguage problems. ALB"We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies," ALBLynch said. "But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax." ALBAfter the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know ALBeach other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every ALBclient has found a potential wife. ALB"At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and ALBthink he hasn't made his mind up," he said. In most cases, marriage follows, ALBusually within the next year. ALBRoongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a ALBBangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less ALBthan 10 percent have broken up. ALBRoongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just ALBarrived in Bangkok looking for a wife. ALB"Sometimes they are very nervous," she said. "And sometimes they are very ALBimpatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm ALBdown, OK, we'll talk."' ALBBut if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife ALBand get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives ALBfor include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic ALBstress disorder. ALBWHY? ALBSimilar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics ALBsay they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to ALBform relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of ALBimpoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West. ALBBut Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is ALBno reason to object. "If you talk about people who are needy, I think ALBeverybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I ALBneed Wan," he said. ALB"Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no ALBsecret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem ALBwith that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to ALBtheir future husband." ALBLynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they ALBchoose to use his agency. ALBHis brochure promises an alternative to the "kind of de-feminized, ALBover-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British ALBsingles scene," and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are ALBnot "God's gift to women." ALBRoongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their ALBown countries -- and found Thai women attractive. ALB"They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques ALBor restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them? ALBImpossible," she said. ALB"Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are ALBgood at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from ALBladies from other countries." ALBAlthough many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap, ALBthe agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also ALBnot a major obstacle. ALB"Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having ALBa husband who is significantly older," Lynch said. "When I met my wife she ALBcouldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic ALBdictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up ALBvery quickly." ALBMany agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move ALBto the West. ALB"We have kitchens, we have study classes," Roongthip said. "We teach them ALBhow to eat, and when to make tea." ALBPITFALLS ALBBut not all dreams come true. "Bee" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to ALBSwitzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is ALBback in Bangkok, sad and angry. ALB"He had no friends, and I was so lonely," she said. "I tried to make him ALBhappy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never ALBspoke to me." ALBBee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. "I thought I would be happy ALBthere," she said. "But it was the worst time of my life." ALBLynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure ALBunsuitable candidates are weeded out. ALB"We are ethical and professional," he said. "We will not take on all ALBcomers." ALBMoylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the ALBarrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company, ALBlooking for a foreign husband. ALB"Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are," ALBMoylan said. "But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal." -- Best regards, bitbitch mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net
