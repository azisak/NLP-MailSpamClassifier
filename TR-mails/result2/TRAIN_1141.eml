Re: The Big Jump So uh, would this qualify for the Darwin awards if he doesn't make it? Freaking french people... :-) -BB RHToday a French officer called Michel Fournier is supposed to get in a RH350-metre tall helium balloon, ride it up to the edge of space (40 km RHaltitude) and jump out. His fall should last 6.5 minutes and reach RHspeeds of Mach 1.5. He hopes to open his parachute manually at the RHend, although with an automatic backup if he is 7 seconds from the RHground and still hasn't opened it.
