DRESS DOWN FRIDAYafter an unexpected 3-month hiatus - because, hey, who buys t-shirts in the summer? - NTK's online store is back to full strength at http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/ and now features lengthy explanations of exactly what PayPal will attempt to charge you. Also new this month: lots of designs now available in XXL, including the ever-popular 404 /SHIRT/TIE NOT FOUND, a glow-in-the-dark variant of the ZX font BORN TO RUN one, plus slightly more limited numbers of the arcade-style HI-SCORE TABLE and the last few remaining souvenirs from June's EXTREME COMPUTING show. Oh and copies of Mark Bennett's BLACK ICE magazine (for just US$7 plus postage and packing) - Brighton's very own answer to "Mondo 2000"... meanwhile, your entries have continued to flood in, a leading contender being CHRIS HOWE's possibly Designers-Republic- influenced http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/chrismessiah.gif - though his email address appears to have changed recently, so if anyone knows where he is, could you ask him to get in touch? We also enjoyed JAMES SWIFT's politically motivated http://www.3dengineer.com/tshirts/privacylogged.gif , BRUCE's heartfelt http://www.growf.org/shirts/crack.gif , and ASHLEY POMEROY's whimsical http://www.ashleypomeroy.com/arpshirts.gif - but remained puzzled by people sending us what appear to be parodies of our existing parody designs, from OWAIN KENWAY's http://www.angelfire.com/scifi2/dsky/1337spotting.html through to JOF's http://www.overhope.org.uk/misc/revolution.jpg and PAUL "THE FRIDAY THING" CARR's perhaps over-self-explanatory: http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/tft-shirt.jpg . And if your design skills aren't up to this high standard, you can of course just mail us a text slogan, so long as it's at least as funny as SIMON LIPSON's "NTK: ROTFL meets ROT-13", ANDREW SIMMONS' "NTK: Notes you don't want to save, and for link evaluation", or PHIL SOUTH's "Frieze - Marther - Farquhar" - but designed to look like it's the name of a law company!... meanwhile, the http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/ gallery reveals the "Buy One, Subvert The Mass Media, Get One Free" contest to be hotting up once again, as 25-year-old web designer GRAEME DAVISON "just happened" to be wearing the shirt that spells "fuck" in ASCII URL-encoding when he was photographed by THE NORTHERN ECHO about his trip to see "Attack Of The Clones" open in LA. Even though this was only a local newspaper, the judging panel felt he deserved the full prize (of another t-shirt), as the story goes on to cover the ostensibly pointless nature of the entire exercise. That's the kind of product placement that money just can't buy... SMALL PRINT 500KB attachments is forbidden by the Geneva Convention. Your country may be at risk if you fail to comply.
