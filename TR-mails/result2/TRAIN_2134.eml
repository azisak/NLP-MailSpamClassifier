Re: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from attacks take a look at http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,102881,00.asp Andrey mailto:andr@sandy.ru BMDoes anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept BMbeen discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know? BMI use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in BMthis post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server BMsystems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and BMnon-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly BMghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or BMno) downtime. BMThanks for any opinions, BMBen
