ICMDecompressionSessionDecodeFrame() is not workingHi All, I am stuck in the quicktime API ICMDecompressionSessionDecodeFrame() for a while, and I could not find any other resources or any other sample code. Could any body help me out, and any suggestions appreciated. I want to import a movie file from local drive, get the compressed video frames, decode them, and encapsulate them into our own UncVideoUnit format. Right now we have already got the compressed video frames, but when we are trying to decode them, we have got some problem. Here is our source code, could any body tell me if there is something wrong in our code. // initialize callback structure ICMDecompressionTrackingCallbackRecord callRecord; callRecord.decompressionTrackingCallback = WriteFrameToBitmap; callRecord.decompressionTrackingRefCon = NULL; // add attributes for pixel buffer that comes out CFMutableDictionaryRef pixelBufferAttributes = NULL; pixelBufferAttributes = CFDictionaryCreateMutable( NULL, 0,  } } Thanks very much.
